# Common Themes

This is a collection of common or well-put-together themes.

The only two near-acceptable in my mind are 1983 and Brewers' Night, I'll be working on the others as time provides.

Gruvbox is a near-copy from a Vim theme ([source](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4349)).

1983 is a color scheme taken from Swatch's WAKTU51 1983 watch ([image](https://web.archive.org/web/20211123050238/https://static.swatch.com/images/product/SO30N400/sa000/SO30N400_sa000_ec004.png)).

Brewers' Night is a color scheme taken from Citizen's Chandler BM8478-01L watch [image](https://citizenwatch.widen.net/content/ixdbsiblnk/jpeg/Chandler.jpeg).

Harbor has salmon, turquoise, and lime on a grey background. Unknown source, it's similar to Monokai.

Blue Moon is similar to Monokai, though with a blue-tone background.
